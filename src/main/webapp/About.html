<h2>The Digital Bhint with 3R Initiative</h2>

<p>
The 3R Initiative and Digital Bhint aims to promote the "3Rs" (reduce, reuse and recycle) globally so as to build a sound-material-cycle society through the effective use of resources and materials.We see,some people can not afford to buy clothes due to high cost in other hand some people waste their clothes.So reducing this gap we developed this platform or Digital Bhint where Rich people sell their wasted cloth to the Dealer so that Rich people earn some money from wasted material and Dealer also get chance to develop small SetUp to earn.In the other hand Poor people can buy this recycled wasted cloth from dealer in minimum amount.
</p>

<h2>What are the 3Rs ?</h2>
<p>
The principle of reducing waste, reusing and recycling resources and products is often called the "3Rs." Reducing means choosing to use things with care to reduce the amount of waste generated. Reusing involves the repeated use of items or parts of items which still have usable aspects. Recycling means the use of waste itself as resources. Waste minimization can be achieved in an efficient way by focusing primarily on the first of the 3Rs, "reduce," followed by "reuse" and then "recycle."

<h3>Reduce</h3>
<p>
The first 'R' in the waste hierarchy is “Reduce.” The crucial thing in the waste management procedure is to maintain a perfect balance in consumption and recycle & reuse. If the consumption is less, the rate of recycling or reuse will also be less.
Reducing isn't only good for the environment. It is also good for your budget.
Reducing means choosing to use things with care to reduce the amount of waste generated.

<h3>Reuse</h3>
<p>
A related term is "repurpose". Items are adjusted and sometimes used for a different purpose. For instance, cloth from old clothing can be turned into a quilt. Rubber from old tires can be woven into welcome mats or used as soling for new shoes. People come up with many creative ways to reuse old items or the materials in them
</p>

<h3>Recycle</h3>
<p>
Turn in your bottles, paper, cardboard and other items into formal recycling programs. Many places have effective recycling programs.
Try to recycle old items by making them into new items. This is informal recycling -- turning old unrepairable clothing into cleaning rags or taking wood from something that is broken and using it to build new furniture.
Organize recycling activities.Recycling of resources also help to produce a country more and more product which can help other people to live a good lifestyle and fullfill their needs.Some of the things which we can recycle are plastic bags,clothes,paper,fruit and vegetable peels etc
</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>
Using the "3Rs" is good for the environment by using up fewer resources. It's useful for society because more people get to benefit from items that are reused and recycled. Recycling is often cheaper than finding and refining new materials. Less space must be devoted to landfills and garbage dumps.
